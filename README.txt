The two objects (keyholderbase and keyholderfinal) in this folder were created for the first FabLab project.
The purpose of these objects was to create a 3D printed piece that compliments an initial item (in our case, keys) that also emphasizes or notes the affordances of the object.
Keyholderbase is the intial design for the team and keyholderfinal is my personal take on the object based on what affordances I associate with a key.
